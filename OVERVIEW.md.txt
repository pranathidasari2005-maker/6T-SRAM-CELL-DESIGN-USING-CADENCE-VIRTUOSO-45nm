6T SRAM Cell – Cadence Virtuoso Implementation (45 nm)
🔹 Project Title

Design and Simulation of a 6T SRAM Cell using Cadence Virtuoso (45 nm Technology)

🔹 Objective

To design and simulate a 6-Transistor Static Random Access Memory (6T SRAM) Cell using Cadence Virtuoso at the transistor level in 45 nm CMOS technology, and verify its correct functionality through schematic and layout (up to LVS verification).

🔹 Project Description

This project presents the design and analysis of a 6T SRAM cell, one of the fundamental building blocks of static random-access memory.
The 6T SRAM cell consists of two cross-coupled CMOS inverters that store a single bit of data, and two NMOS access transistors that connect the cell to the bitlines during read and write operations.

The project focuses on:

Circuit-level design in Cadence Virtuoso

Functional simulation using Spectre

Layout design according to 45 nm design rules

DRC and LVS verification

🔹 Working Principle
🟢 Write Operation

The Word Line (WL) is asserted high.

Data on Bit Line (BL) and Bit Line Bar (BLB) overwrites the previous cell content through the access transistors.

Depending on the input, one storage node is pulled low while the other is pulled high.

🔵 Read Operation

Both bitlines are precharged before the read.

The Word Line is enabled; one bitline discharges slightly depending on the stored data.

Sense amplifiers detect this voltage difference without altering the stored bit.

⚫ Hold Operation

When the Word Line is low, the access transistors are off.

The cross-coupled inverters retain the stored logic level through feedback.
